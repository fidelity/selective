# Contributing to our Library

We welcome contributions of all from everybody, and we will make an effort
to respond to any questions and requests. Code is not the only way to make
a contribution!

If you end up using our library in a project, give us a star on GitHub!

## Code Contributions

- With any piece of code, please adhere to PEP-8 standards.
- If you're fixing an issue with an existing piece of code, please make sure
all the tests pass, and there is no change in functionality.
- If you want to add a new feature, please open up an issue first.
- When adding a new feature, make sure you have relevant test coverage.
- Any changes to the public API should conform to the current standards,
be properly documented, typed, and be intuitive.
